# Text-Editor

##

## [Description](#table-of-contents)

Created a simple text editor app that can function both online and offline. The application first uses the data in indexedDB to populate the editor, then if it cannot access that it will use local storage. This application can be downloaded to your desktop as an application. This application is helpful to developers because it can be used as a notepad for codes that need to be written down.

I have included a link to download my demo video as well as a link to the video on youtube.
